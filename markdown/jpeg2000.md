JPEG2000 is an other lossless image compression algorithm. Yet, it could be interresting to see if our methodology obtains satisfying results on JPEG2000 too.

With an XGBoost Regressor, we obtain even better results as for PNG, we get $R^2=0.940$ and MAE% $= 2.05%$. Also, 92.5% of test images obtain less than 5% of error.
