Compression algorithms are used in a wide range of domains, from long range telecommunications, to storing videos on a mobile phone. Then, our objective is to estimate actual compression performance from data. We first focus on lossless PNG compression, using sparsity measures and making parallels with clustering and image processing. Then, we test our approach on other kinds of data, and compression algorithms.
