### Zip

Lots of file compression tools (G-Zip, 7-Zip) use LZ-class algorithms to compress ZIP files. Then, we attempt to adapt our work on PNG compression (also LZ-class) to ZIP files. We use 27 Gb of personnal files as a dataset. Existing solutions compress the beginning of the file, and extrapolate from there.
